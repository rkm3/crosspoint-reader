/**
 * Explicit Readwise synchronization: connect Wi-Fi if needed, run the sync
 * engine (push queued ops, pull changed metadata, rebuild indexes, commit the
 * checkpoint), show the outcome.
 *
 * Follows KOReaderSyncActivity's shape: blocking network work on the main loop
 * task with RenderLock'd state updates, no cancellation once started, and the
 * WiFi teardown + silent restart in onExit() to shed heap fragmentation. A
 * failed sync preserves the previous checkpoint and the pending queue by
 * construction (that is the engine's contract, proven by the native tests).
