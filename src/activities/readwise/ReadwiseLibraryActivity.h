/**
 * Offline browser for the synced Readwise locations.
 *
 * Reads only the local index and metadata files -- no network. Row 0 is the
 * "Sync now" entry (which pushes ReadwiseSyncActivity); document rows open the
 * cached body, or download it on demand when absent. A long Confirm press
 * queues an archive, which takes effect locally immediately via
 * rebuildLocal().
 *
 * Only one visible window of metadata is resident at a time: documents are
 * ~800 bytes each and a full 100-document cap would be ~80 KB.
